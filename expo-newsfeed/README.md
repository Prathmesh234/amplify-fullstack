# Expo News Feed App

This sample Expo project demonstrates a TikTok-style news feed with Google OAuth authentication via Clerk.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies from the `expo-newsfeed` directory:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Set your Clerk publishable key in `App.js`.

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the Expo development environment where you can run the app on iOS, Android, or web.

## Features

- Google OAuth sign in/out using Clerk (no email/password).
- Stack navigation and infinite scrolling feed implemented with React Navigation.
- Modern card design with placeholder data for future integration with a real backend.

This folder is self-contained and does not depend on the rest of the repository.
